# OPM-3: Define Team Principles

Date: 01-08-2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In our system, we expect teams to be self-forming. But, in order to improve team effectiveness, we'll define principles that teams must conform to when they are formed.

## Decision

Teams MUST follow the following principles:

1. Teams are [cross-functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-functional_team). Embedding a cross-section of skills in the team will reduce inter-team coordination and allow teams to make more autonomous decisions.
2. Team membership is limited to roles that directly influence the output of the team. Because we have a constraint of [8 team members](OPM-1-Decision-Tracking.md), we need to ensure that team membership is limited to roles that are highly releveant to a team's work.

## Consequences

These principles are aspirational and subjective in nature. The effectiveness of team formation will ultimately rely on good decision making by those who form the teams and an understanding of the shared goal of the system.

As a result, it will be important that team leaders are talented enough to make independent, autonomous decisions that align with these principles.
