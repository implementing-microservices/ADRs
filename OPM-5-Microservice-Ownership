# OPM-5: Microservice Ownership
Date: 01-08-2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide on the relationship between our team structure and our microservices structure.

## Decision

Each team owns one (or more) microservices. A microservice cannot be owned by more than one team. A single team owns decision making responsibility for its microservices and can operate it autonomously within the constraints of the system.

## Consequences

Constraining and bounding ownership will help teams move faster, but will put added pressure on establishing the right team boundaries. If team boundaries are formed poorly, this will result in an unacceptable level of cross-team coordination.
