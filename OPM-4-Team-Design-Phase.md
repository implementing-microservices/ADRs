# OPM-4: Team Design Phase

Date: 01-08-2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide when to design team structures and coordination models. For example, should we design teams to align with a software architecture or the other way around?

## Decision

We'll start by focusing on team structures before we dig into the design of the software architecture and microservices. This allows us to inform the microservices design by designing teams first.
We'll also continually update and improve the team design throughout the life of the system.

## Consequences

Starting with team design means we'll need a way to design team structures with an understanding of the impact to the software architecture and coordination model.
